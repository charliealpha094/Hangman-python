# Hangman-python

This is a simple classic hangman game created with Python. The hangman_words includes a list of words that will be randomly 
choosed by the script, and the hangman_art file includes the graphic stages of the game lives.
There are only 6 lives.
I made this script mainly to practice while and for loops, so I didn't bother about using functions nor classes.
Obviously the code would look better and more organized, but scince this is a small script, I opted to do it in a simpler way.
